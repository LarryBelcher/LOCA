README for the LOCA downscaled Climate projections temperature fields

Abstract:
This project contains a suite of python scripts to process and visualize LOCA (Localized 
Constructed Analogs) data. The averaging scripts produce ten-year averages (2020-2029, 
2030-2039...2090-2099) of daily temperature data for each month, while the visualization 
scripts produce conterminous US maps of the results.

Methodology:
The LOCA data used in this project come are NetCDF files for maximum (tasmax) and minimum 
(tasmin) daily temperature. The average daily temperature (tavg) data were derived from
these, e.g., tasmax+tasmin/2. The daily values for each variable in a given month in a given
decade are then averaged for each model (for models, see list below). The "ensemble" median
is then calculated by taking the median of all models for a given month during a given 
decade. The results have been calculated for each field (tasmax, tasmin, and tavg), 
which are then visualized on conterminous US maps.

Description from AWS site:
	Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA)
The LOCA (Localized Constructed Analogs) dataset includes downscaled projections from 32 
global climate models calculated for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and
RCP 8.5). Each of the climate projections includes daily maximum temperature, minimum 
temperature, and precipitation for every 6x6km for the conterminous US from 1950 to 2100.
LOCA attempts to better preserve extreme hot days and heavy rain events, regional patterns
of precipitation. The total dataset size is approximately 10 TB. For further information 
on the methods and contents of the data refer to the source page here: (http://loca.ucsd.edu/).
